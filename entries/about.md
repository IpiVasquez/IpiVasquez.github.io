# Hi, I'm Hector
I'm a Mexican software developer. They call me Ipi.

I studied at Technological University of the Mixteca and specialize in Java, Python, JavaScript and HTML5.

I love Web Development.

I'm passionate about new technologies and the solutions these can bring to raising problems.

I encourage team work and I firmly believe Computer Science is nothing without the community behind it.
